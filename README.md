## Key concepts

intent
What is the user trying to do (e.g. greeting, search for restaurant)

entity


Named entity recognition (NER)



r"" the r indicates this will be raw - so can include characters such as \

b(hello|hi) - the b is for boundary. this excludes occasions when the words in brackets are part of bigger words (e.g. hi is in shin)
